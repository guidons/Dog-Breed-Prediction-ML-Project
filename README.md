# Dog Breed Prediction in Zurich

## Problem Description
This project aims to identify factors influencing dog breed choices among owners in Zurich, Switzerland, considering both dog characteristics (size, appearance, etc.) and social factors (status, celebrity influence). The task is approached as a classification problem, using logistic regression and random forest models for comparison.

## Data Source
The data is sourced from the City of Zurich's open data portal, collected by Identitas, and contains information about dog owners (age, gender, location) and their dogs (breed, age, color, mixed-breed indicators).
